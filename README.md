## 📖 Installation

<details>  
<summary><strong>How to install macOS</strong></summary>
</br>

1. [Create an installation media](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/#making-the-installer)
1. Download the [latest EFI folder](https://github.com/simprecicchiani/ThinkPad-T460s-macOS-OpenCore/releases) and copy it into the ESP partiton
1. Change your BIOS settings according to the table below
1. Boot from the USB installer (press `F12` to choose boot volume) and [start the installation process](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installation/installation-process.html#booting-the-opencore-usb)

### BIOS Config

</details>

<details>  
<summary><strong>Enable Apple Services</strong></summary>
</br>

Config to allow you to use Apple Services (such as iMessage)

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you (still) can't login to iMessage you may need to contact Apple Support to unblacklist your AppleID (You can try opening the Message app from terminal to check the log to see if you're getting a Customer Code error, which is an indication that your AppleID got blacklisted. [See more info here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#customer-code-error))

1. Download (or clone) [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) and run it in terminal
2. Type `3` to generate SMBIOS, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
3. Type `MacBookPro15,2 5`, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
4. Open `EFI/Config.plist` (I highly recommend using [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree)) and navigate to `PlatformInfo -> Generic`
5. Add one of the script's result to `MLB`, `SystemSerialNumber`, and `SystemUUID`
7. Replace `ROM` with your MAC Address (`System Preferences -> Network -> Ethernet -> Advanced -> Hardware -> MAC Address`, then remove all the colons `:`). Or you can also try using a real Apple MAC Address
8. Save and Reboot
9. Check the Serial Number validity. Repeat step 5 and choose different result (or generate new set of SMBIOS) until you find invalid Serial Number

## 🧰 Post-install (optional)

<details>  
<summary><strong>Audio Setup</strong></summary>

The X380 Yoga has CX8200 for audio which requires the boot-arg **or** device property below. You can use the boot-args to initially setup your config.plist file as suggested in the guide or simply add the device property. Everything should work, built-in microphone, speakers, headphone jack and microphone. 

NVRAM:

| Key       | Value    |
| --------- | -------- |
| boot-args | alcid=23 |

DeviceProperties

| Key                        | Type       | Value        |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x3) | Dictionary |              |
| layout-id                  | Data       | **0f000000** |

</details>

<details>  
<summary><strong>Enable Intel WLAN cards</strong></summary>
</br>

Although the Intel AC-8265 Card is compatible with both kexts (use either one or the other), there are Pros and Cons to both of them (check the [**FAQs**](https://openintelwireless.github.io/itlwm/FAQ.html#features) for other differences):

- **AirportItlwm**: (used in macOS Sonoma)
	- **Pro**: Can be used during macOS Setup/Recoveery which is not possible with `itlwm.kext`
	- **Pro**: Supports Location Services and "Find My Mac"
 	- **Pro**: Connects faster to Wi-Fi Hotspots than `itlwm.kext`
	- **Con**: Doesn't perform as well as `itlwm.kext`
	- **Con**: Can't connect to hidden WiFi Networks
	- **Con**: Requires the correct kext per macOS version, so running multiple version of macOS requires multiple versions of this kext controlled via `MinKernel` and `MaxKernel` settings

- **itlwm.kext** (used in Sequoia)
	- **Pro**: `itlwm.kext` works across _multiple_ versions of macOS
	- **Pro**: Loading webpages feels a lot quicker than with `AirportItlwm` 
	- **Pro**: Can connect to hidden WiFi Networks
 	- **Pro**: Does work with iMessage and FaceTime 	
	- **Con**: Requires [**HeliPort**](https://github.com/diepeterpan/HeliPort/releases) app to connect to Wi-Fi hotspots, so it can't be used during macOS Setup/Recovery
	- **Con**: Doesn't support Location Services

- Pre-compiled WiFi kexts for other versions of macOS can be found in the [Additional Files](hhttps://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases) section! You will need them if you want to run other macOS versions than Sonoma or Sequioa!

> [!NOTE]
> 
> My config uses `AirportItlw.kext` by default since it allows accessing the internet during macOS installation (unlike `itlwm.kext` which requires an additional app to do so). Currently, AirportItlwm kexts for macOS Sequoia is included but you must patch, you can find how to patch [`see this`](https://osxlatitude.com/forums/topic/20330-wifi-in-sequoia-150-beta-patching-for-legacy-broadcom-wireless-cards/). If you want to use itlwm, disable AirportItlwm (all variants) and enable itlwm in the config.plist instead. Next, download the Helipad app, run it and add it to "Login Items" (in System Settings) so that it starts automatically with macOS.

<summary><strong>CPUFriend power management</strong></summary>
<br>

Generate `CPUFriendDataProvider` or `ssdt_data.aml` (choose one) for your machine [here](https://github.com/acidanthera/CPUFriend) or use the ssd_data.aml file provided. My files are set for power conservation over performance. Highly recommended that you use power management.

</details>

<details> 
<summary><strong>USB Port Mapping</strong></summary>

While first port mapping I followed the [Dortania guide here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/#macos-and-the-15-port-limit) with USBInjectAll.kext install...  when doing so the internal USB ports did not show up and the cameras, touch screen, and bluetooth did not function. I noticed on the `USBmap tool` screen that RHUB was showing so I Googled it and it brought me back to the [Dortania guide here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/manual/manual.html#special-notes). I added the SSDT-RHUB.aml to the APCI folder rebooted and all the ports showed up. I then mapped the USB ports creating the included USBMap.kext file.

<details>  
<summary><strong>Setup hibernation and sleep</strong></summary>
</br>

[Script](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/release-sleeponlowbattery-solb.264785) that performs auto sleep/hibernate at low battery.

1. Open terminal
1. Enter commands below one by one

   Settings for AC:

   ```
   sudo pmset -c standby 1
   sudo pmset -c hibernatemode 0
   ```

   Setting for battery:

   ```
   sudo pmset -b standby 1
   sudo pmset -b standbydelayhigh 900
   sudo pmset -b standbydelaylow 60
   sudo pmset -b hibernatemode 25
   sudo pmset -b highstandbythreshold 70
   ```

   Settings for all:

   ```
   sudo pmset -a acwake 0
   sudo pmset -a lidwake 1
   sudo pmset -a powernap 0
   ```

To restore default system settings run

```
sudo pmset restoredefaults
```

<details>  
<summary><strong>Advanced energy management</strong></summary>

`acwake`: wake the machine when power source (AC/battery) is changed (value = 0/1)

`lidwake`: wake the machine when the laptop lid (or clamshell) is opened (value = 0/1)

`powernap`: enable/disable Power Nap on supported machines (value = 0/1)

`standbydelayhigh` and `standbydelaylow` specify the delay, in seconds,
before writing the hibernation image to disk and powering off memory for Standby.
standbydelayhigh is used when the remaining battery capacity is above `highstandbythreshold`(has a default value of 50 percent),
and standbydelaylow is used when the remaining battery capacity is below highstandbythreshold.

`hibernatemode` supports values of 0, 3, or 25. To disable hibernation, set hibernatemode to 0.  
`hibernatemode` = 0 by default on desktops. The system will not back memory up to persistent storage. The system must wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on power loss.  
`hibernatemode` = 3 by default on portables. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from hibernate image.  
`hibernatemode` = 25 is only settable via pmset. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want "hibernation" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you should use this setting.
